# Project 3- Quiz!
## Task
Welcome to project 3! Use your newfound skills in coding in JS to create one of the following projects. Choose your spicy level:

### ðŸŒ¶ Mild
* Madlibs- recreate the madlibs quiz we did in class, except you must use at least 10 parts of speech. The project can be completely made up or a combination of a madlib you find online plus your own work. Follow the format from lab 12 to complete this project
  * Parts of speech you can use: noun, adjective, verd, adverb, feeling/emotion, color, silly word, etc. Feel free to use some of these more than once!
### ðŸŒ¶ðŸŒ¶ Medium
* Number Guesser- use earlier labs to create a number guesser that is not displayed in the index. Once someone guesses the number, you should be able to tell them what the number was if they guessed incorrectly.
### ðŸŒ¶ðŸŒ¶ðŸŒ¶ Spicy
* Create a quiz that asks the person to answer a series of questions correctly. Must have a score at the end. This can be history, math, ELA, geography, facts, etc.
  * If multiple choice, do at least 4 questions with 4 choices each.
  * If question and answer, do at least 7 questions.


## Requirements
1. Must set up your index using IDs (classes optional).
2. Must style your page to look visually pleasing for the user(HTML and CSS).
3. Must include some JS elements we learned in lessons 9-12:
   * innerHTML
   * span
   * window.prompt
   * variables
   * conditional statements
   * operators
   * case-sensitivity

### Extra Credit opportunities:
* Style each span a different way so users can see their answers to the questions.
* Do more than the set limits for the project you select (like doing more than 10 parts of speech)
* Include something new we haven't learned yet (consider using the student slides).
* Add Bootstrap components.
#### NOTE: Bootstrap is NOT linked this time! Please let me know if you need help setting that up.
